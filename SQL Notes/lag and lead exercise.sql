/*
Write a query that can extract the following information from the "employees" database:
- the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts signed by all employees numbered between 10500 and 10600 inclusive
- a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list
- a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list
- a column displaying the difference between the current salary of a certain employee and their previous salary
- a column displaying the difference between the next salary of a certain employee and their current salary
Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.
Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number. */

select emp_no, 
	salary, 
	lag(salary) over w as previous_salary,
    lead(salary) over w as next_salary,
    salary - lag(salary) over w as salary_diff_current_previous,
    lead(salary) over w - salary as salary_diff_next_current
from salaries 
where salary >80000 and
emp_no between 10500 and 10600
window w as (partition by emp_no order by salary);


/*
The MySQL LAG() and LEAD() value window functions can have a second argument, designating how many rows/steps back 
(for LAG()) or forth (for LEAD()) we'd like to refer to with respect to a given record.
With that in mind, create a query whose result set contains data arranged by the salary values associated to each employee number 
(in ascending order). Let the output contain the following six columns:
- the employee number
- the salary value of an employee's contract (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as the employee's current salary)
- the employee's previous salary
- the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary
- the employee's next salary
- the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary
Restrict the output to the first 1000 records you can obtain. */

select emp_no, 
	salary, 
    lag(salary) over w as previous_salary,
	lag(salary, 2) over w as 1_before_previous_salary,
    lead(salary) over w as next_salary,
    lead(salary, 2) over w as 1_after_next_salary
from salaries
window w as (partition by emp_no order by salary)
limit 1000;
